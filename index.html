    <h3>This is an H3 header</h3>

    <p>
      This a paragraph about H3 headers. Well, not really because I have to test
      out subscripts and superscripts. An example of a subscript is the chemical
      formula for water, H<sub>2</sub>O. An example of a superscript is this
      polynomial: 3x<sup>2</sup>+12x-63. Pay attention to the 2 in each example.
